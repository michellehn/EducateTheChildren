											<h1>Photo Essay #4: New Project Area 2014!</h1>

												<p>Educate the Children will be bringing our time-tested and effective programs to a new set of villages beginning in mid-2014. We are the grateful recipient of a grant to enable us to start off strong in this new program area, which includes the Village Development Committees (VDCs) of Lapilang, Lamidanda, and Babare - to the immediate north of where we have been working since 2008. Click here to see a map. </p>

												<p>The photos below were all taken in Lapilang VDC in March 2014. (Click on any thumbnail to see a larger version of that photo.) The schools pictured are among those where we'll be working, and as you can see, there is a real need for improvement! The children pictured are also among those whom we'll be serving - they will benefit from better educational opportunities and being able to eat more food of higher nutritional quality. </p>

												<img class='container-img' src = '../../../assets/img/newspages/n3.jpg' id = 'news3.php-2' alt = 'news3.php-2'/>
												<p>The classrooms pictured above will be physically improved (by being plastered, painted, having flooring installed, etc.) and will also receive new furniture and equipment such as tables, shelving, mats and carpeting, white boards and chalkboards, and useful educational supplies (puzzles, maps, charts, games, etc.) Many teachers will also receive training in best practices to help them engage their students more fully. The result will be a more attractive and enriching environment for both children and teachers. School personnel in schools where ETC has previously worked have consistently reported better student attendance and performance, as well as their own increased job satisfaction!</p>

												<img class='container-img' src = '../../../assets/img/newspages/n4.jpg' id = 'news3.php-3' alt = 'news3.php-3'/>
												<p>The children pictured above, and thousands of others, will have far better educational opportunities than their parents and grandparents ever did. They will have the best possible chance grow to become healthy, productive adults! ETC (working closely with their parents and teachers over the next few years) will ensure that they can attend (and finish!) school, that their mothers will become literate and have the skills and resources to earn more money, and that they and their families will be healthier and better nourished!</p>

												<img class='container-img' src = '../../../assets/img/newspages/n5.jpg' id = 'news3.php-4' alt = 'news3.php-4'/>
												<p>Most men and women in these villages - such as the man pictured above - work for pennies a day in the fields of wealthy, generally absentee landlords. ETC will provide training and supplies for women to grow their own kitchen gardens, and hundreds will also start small agribusinesses such as goat or poultry farms or market gardening enterprises. These activities improve families' nutritional intake as well as household incomes!</p>
