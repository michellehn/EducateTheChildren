			<h2>Interested in Volunteering in Nepal?</h2>
			<p>Anyone interested in volunteering in Nepal must be able to pay for his or her own transportation and living expenses, including the cost of getting to and from Nepal. <br><br>If you are fluent in English, you may be able to help our Kathmandu staff with activities related to communications and reporting. The need for this sort of assistance is very occasional, and it is difficult to predict when or if it will be needed. <br><br>If you have experience in working with children and have at least six months to offer - a year would be even better! - then you may be able to teach English, mathematics, or science to children in rural schools. <br><br>Other long-term opportunities may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

			<h2>Interested in Volunteering in Ithaca?</h2>
			<p>Our Ithaca staff consists of two part-time people, working from our homes. There is no physical office to which you can come, and our needs are very sporadic. If, just as an example, you need to achieve 50 hours of volunteer work within a relatively short time period, then we are very unlikely to be able to promise you sufficient work. However, we occasionally have some project- and time-specific needs.<br><br>If you are interested in joining the U.S. Board of Directors and have expertise in such areas as marketing/public relations, fundraising, event planning, or accounting/finance, please contact Lisa or Teresa for more information.
